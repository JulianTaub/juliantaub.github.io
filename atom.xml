    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last post, we gathered up some useful methods for our journey. Now let’s take next step: entering the dream space.</p>

<p>Remember that this is our target dream:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">    dreams = { 
     :dream_one =&gt;{
        :location =&gt; "grandma's house",
        :people =&gt; ["Grandma", "Grandpa", "Sis", "Brother", "Auntie Charlotte"],
        :discussions =&gt; ["ancient aliens", "superheroes turned Senators", "ninjas"],
        :items =&gt; {
          "bratwurst" =&gt; {
             :color =&gt; 'Firetruck red',
             :shape =&gt; 'Cylindrical',
             :satisfying =&gt; true,
           },
          "sofa" =&gt; {
             :color =&gt; 'burnt sienna',
             :shape =&gt; 'L-shaped',
             :satisfying =&gt; true,
           }
        }
      }
     :dream_two =&gt;{
        :location =&gt; 'enchanted forest',
        :people =&gt; ['woodsman', 'wizard', 'Sleepy Tom', 'Butters', 'Tinkerbell'],  
        :discussions =&gt; ['politics', 'magic','good', 'evil'],
        :items =&gt; {
           "tree of life" =&gt; {
               :power =&gt; 'vivaciousness',
               :state =&gt; 'glowing',
               :color =&gt; 'golden',
               :shape =&gt; 'branchy',
               :blissful =&gt; true   
               },
            "magic potion" =&gt; {
              :power =&gt; 'strength',
               :state =&gt; 'bubbly',
               :color =&gt; 'purple',
               :shape =&gt; 'liquid',
               :blissful =&gt; false   
              } 
         }
     }     
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Still scary, right? Not to worry - as we venture through the levels of the dream, we’ll keep track of where we are at in two ways:
drawing out our current level in a comment above a method
a handy library (referred to as ‘gems’ in Ruby) called ‘pry’</p>

<p>Adding comments (descriptive lines that don’t affect your program) above your code can help you map out the dream as you work your way through it and be used as a reference points if you get stuck.</p>

<p>Pry, on the other hand, freezes a program as it’s running and lets you peer inside of it.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/cxged4or0Ksmc/giphy.gif" alt="Freeze frame of girl throwing orange up in the air and reflection in mirror walking away" /></p>

<p>It even lets you play around with all the inner variables and test them all out.  All you need is two lines of code inserted into the area that you want to check out:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">  require ‘pry’
  binding.pry
</code></pre>

<p>‘Require’ imports the gem into your file, so it can be on hand, and the second line triggers pry to stop whatever program that crosses paths with it and reveal its binding. Binding is the ‘universe according to that line of the program’ - all of its variables, methods, and values.</p>

<h3>Entering the Dream</h3>

<p>As you enter the dream, you have two goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li> Collect data on the dream</li>
<li> Add bottles of Tap to the dream</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the top level:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">  # Level 1: Tale of Two Dreams
  # dreams = {:dream_one =&gt; {...}, :dream_two =&gt; {...}}
  dreams.each do |dream, dream_content|


  end
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re just scoping out our path interating through the dream, so we haven&rsquo;t added anything logic inside the block yet. Also, make sure that you name your parameters (here &lsquo;dream&rsquo; for the keys and &lsquo;dream content&rsquo; for the values) in a way that is clear and makes sense to you.</p>

<p>This level doesn&rsquo;t seem that useful. We&rsquo;re ping-ponging between two dreams, each pointing to nested hashes which contain the dream content. So&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/531/557/a88.jpg" alt="'We need to go deeper' meme from inception" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s enter the next level:</p>

<pre><code class="`ruby">  # Level 1: Tale of Two Dreams
  # dreams = {:dream_one =&gt; {...}, :dream_two =&gt; {...}}
  dreams.each do |dream, dream_content|
    # Level 2: Content is King
    # {:location =&gt; "...", :people =&gt; [...], :discussions= [...], :items =&gt; {...}}
    dream_content.each do |type, attributes|


    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have much more to work with. We have a list of different types of data in the dream (location, people, and items), a map of where different things may be located, and an overall sense of the string&rsquo;s structure.</p>

<p>The marketing company wants to know each type of content, and the structure that each one points to. They also want to compare this level between different dreams.</p>

<p>Easy enough. Lets iterate through everything and print it to the screen, focusing on the type name and the attribute Object class:</p>

<pre><code class="`ruby">  # Level 1: Tale of Two Dreams
  # dreams = {:dream_one =&gt; {...}, :dream_two =&gt; {...}}
  dreams.each do |dream, dream_content|
    # Level 2: Content is King
    # {:location =&gt; "...", :people =&gt; [...], :discussions= [...], :items =&gt; {...}}
    dream_content.each do |type, attributes|
     puts "#{type} points to a(n) #{attribute.class}."
    end
  end

  =&gt; location points to a(n) String.
     people point(s) to a(n) Array.
     discussions point(s) to a(n) Array.
     items point(s) to a(n) Hash.
</code></pre>

<p>  Now that you have printed out this information, you have everything you need to incept bottles of Tap into the dream. You know where you want to insert them and the data structures you&rsquo;ll be dealing with. Therefore, you can prepare the path to inception and methods needed beforehand.</p>

<p>  Let&rsquo;s get two new bottles of Tap for dream insertion:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">    tap_one = Tap.new
    tap_two = Tap.new
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to target the discussion and item types. Discussion points to an array, meaning that we can just push tap_one into the end of the array. Let&rsquo;s also use .collect to iterate over dream_content, so that the inception will be sure to solidify:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we want to pass tap_two into items. We don&rsquo;t know what items themselves point to inside the hash, but we don&rsquo;t need to. Brands love distinguishing themselves from the flock, so we just have to make whatever tap_two points to compelling. Here we go:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You successfully incepted this dream! The marketeers are overjoyed. The campaign was a success and you&rsquo;re getting job offers left and right for inception contracts, even from the US government- regarding a secret mission to incept the dreams of foreign revolutionaries and make them more America-friendly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of programming is working through layers of data to retrieve or manipulate the necessary values. Wading into giant, deep containers of virtual lists an associatons can be daunting, but once you get more familiar with them, they come easier to navigate.</p>

<p>We’ve invited the characters of the movie Inception to help us out.</p>

<p><img src="http://topwalls.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/inception-movie.jpg" alt="inception poster: hanging around in the middle of a street that curves 90 degrees vertically" /></p>

<p>Let’s say you’re a contractor hired by the Tap Soft Drink company to infiltrate potential customers’ dreams and place bottles of Tap in “meaningful” parts of their dreams. They also want you to collect data on the content of people’s dreams, so that they can market to the public better. You’re a bit rusty on your dream infiltration technique, so you ask the team from Inception to bring you up to speed.</p>

<p>The dream layout looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">    dreams = { 
     :dream_one =&gt;{
        :location =&gt; "grandma's house",
        :people =&gt; ["Grandma", "Grandpa", "Sis", "Brother", "Auntie Charlotte"],
        :discussions =&gt; ["ancient aliens", "superheroes turned Senators", "ninjas"],
        :items =&gt; {
          "bratwurst" =&gt; {
             :color =&gt; 'Firetruck red',
             :shape =&gt; 'Cylindrical',
             :satisfying =&gt; true,
           },
          "sofa" =&gt; {
             :color =&gt; 'burnt sienna',
             :shape =&gt; 'L-shaped',
             :satisfying =&gt; true,
           }
        }
      }
     :dream_two =&gt;{
        :location =&gt; 'enchanted forest',
        :people =&gt; ['woodsman', 'wizard', 'Sleepy Tom', 'Butters', 'Tinkerbell'],  
        :discussions =&gt; ['politics', 'magic','good', 'evil'],
        :items =&gt; {
           "tree of life" =&gt; {
               :power =&gt; 'vivaciousness',
               :state =&gt; 'glowing',
               :color =&gt; 'golden',
               :shape =&gt; 'branchy',
               :blissful =&gt; true   
               },
            "magic potion" =&gt; {
              :power =&gt; 'strength',
               :state =&gt; 'bubbly',
               :color =&gt; 'purple',
               :shape =&gt; 'liquid',
               :blissful =&gt; false   
              } 
         }
     }     
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing is that you want is to get in and out of the dream as quickly as possible while completing your objective. Without the right constrainsts, you can end up stuck in a dream, forever!</p>

<p>Don’t do this:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">    while dream do
       print “#{dream[:items]} ,”
    end

Or this:

    loop do
       print “#{dream[:items]} ,”
    end
</code></pre>

<p>You will end up with this:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/ZAv0VrzFL29k4/giphy.gif" alt="limbo and total desctruction" /></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve entered a never-ending loop that crashes your program!</p>

<p>You need to supply the variables to make sure you have a safe time. An incrementor like i is handy. The flow i =0, i &lt; (a number) and i+=1 inside the loop can help keep everything in check.</p>

<p>Even better are methods that run through each element of data structures like an Array (similar to a list of elements) or a Hash (a list of keys that each point to, or associate with, a value). These types of methods, like each, collect, select and inject use an object called a block while operating. You can think of the block as an ambiguous dreamlike space that methods can yield their consciousness to. Just like dreams, things outside the block can appear inside the block, but anything defined in the block don’t exist on the outside.</p>

<p>Let’s go through a few main methods that you might use:</p>

<h4>Each</h4>

<p>The .each method goes through each element, hands it over to the block, and returns exactly what you gave it. It’s like having a dream, forgetting about it, and going about your day the next morning. One of the ways programmers use .each is by printing out each element from the block to the screen.</p>

<p>Array:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">      [1, 2, 3, 4].each do |num|             
           num * 2                                      
        end
  =&gt;     [1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>Hash:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">    names = {:name_one =&gt; “Julian”, :name_two =&gt; “Jeremy”}
    names.each do |key, value|
      value + “is awesome”             
    end
    =&gt;   {:name_one =&gt; “Julian”, :name_two =&gt; “Jeremy”}
</code></pre>

<h4>Collect</h4>

<p>The .collect method is the “inception” method. Whatever happens inside the block changes the data structure .collect is affecting. You can plant easter eggs in the array or hash, and manipulate things to your liking. Dom Cobb would be proud.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/S5S8rQ50V0ITK/giphy.gif" alt="Leonardo explains: And they fill it with their subconscious" /></p>

<p>Array:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">      [1, 2, 3, 4].collect do |num|             
           num * 2                                      
        end
  =&gt;     [2, 4, 6, 8]
</code></pre>

<p>Hash:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">    names = {:name_one =&gt; “Julian”, :name_two =&gt; “Jeremy”}
    names.collect do |key, value|
      value + “is awesome”             
    end
    =&gt;   {:name_one =&gt; “Julian is awesome”, :name_two =&gt; “Jeremy is awesome”}
</code></pre>

<h4>Select</h4>

<p>The .select method returns a data structure filled only with values that are inherently true. How you define what is true inside the block is up to you. This method is great for filtering out unnecessary parts of an array or dream, and obtain only the element you wanted all along.</p>

<p>Array:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">      fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'banana']
      fruits.select do |num|             
           'apple'                                      
        end
  =&gt;     ['apple', 'apple']
</code></pre>

<h4>Inject</h4>

<p>The .inject method takes an element and makes it interact with the upcoming elment. It keeps carrying over these values until they accumulate until it accumulates into a giant final snowball. It&rsquo;s like bringing on what you come across in one dream on to the next dream.</p>

<p>Array:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">      [1, 2, 3, 4].inject do |sum, num|             
           sum + num                                      
        end
  =&gt;     10  
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the tools to do basic iteration, next post we&rsquo;ll tackle the dream.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-29T17:45:36-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://juliantaub.github.io/blog/2015/04/29/where-the-value-goes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One crucial topic I constantly come across as I am studying at Flatiron is that I always need to be aware and keep track of what values my variables hold throughout my code and how they change over time.</p>

<p>I cannot drill this into my head enough. Or tell you how many times being sloppy has ruined an afternoon.</p>

<p>Let’s start at the very beginning…</p>

<p>The Ruby language has very few set keywords, so most of the work will come from you, the programmer, defining your own variables, meaning storing information by associating a name with a value (or technically, an object that has a value):</p>

<pre><code class="`ruby">  x = 14
  food = “pasta”
  cities = [New York, Berlin, Dallas, Shanghai]
</code></pre>

<p>You use the variables as placeholders for data, so you can manipulate it for whatever program you’re working on. The problem arises when you call methods on the data, functions that operate on data in specific ways. Some are fairly straight forward. For example, most people can infer that:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">  x = 14
  x = x + 6
</code></pre>

<p>reassigns x to equal 20. However, other methods are less obvious. It’s always important to understand how each one “returns” a value. A method like puts prints to your screen, but returns a nil value. Other methods will change a copy of the data, leaving the variable’s original data intact.</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">  puts “Return me, please!” # =&gt; nil

  name = “Julian”
  name.upcase  # =&gt; “JULIAN”
  name         # =&gt; “Julian” 
</code></pre>

<p>Some guidelines to keep in mind while tracking your variable:</p>

<ul>
<li> Ruby always returns the last value of a program. Think of how to use that to your advantadge.</li>
<li> Ruby has built-in implicit returns, meaning just writing the variable is enough to get the value.</li>
<li> Just because something is printed on the screen, doesn’t mean that the same value was returned in the program.</li>
<li> Keep track of incrementing values, and methods that take multiple arguments</li>
<li> Always read documentation for the nitty-gritty details. <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby-doc.org</a> is the place to be.</li>
<li> Get dirty in the sandbox: Test out code snippets in the terminal using <em>irb</em>, or hacking into programs as they are running, using the <em>pry</em> gem.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Brazilian culture, the word “malandro” is a very controversial term. It’s usually has the connotation of a rogue, a gutter-punk, or a trickster. Someone who is very devious and dosen’t play by the rules. They follow a way of life called “malandragem,” or getting the advantage by any means possible.</p>

<p>It evokes a bit of a bad-boy persona, one that’s memorialized in songs and folklore.</p>

<p>There it describes someone who is extremely versatile and can problem solve on cue. Fluid situational awareness and unconventional problem solving then take on an almost positive quality.</p>

<p>The word “hacker” can be just as controversial. In the programming community, hackers are inventive makers and testers, participating in a vibrant collaborative community. To the outside world, hackers are malcontents and thieves, bent on destroying people’s online lives and corrupt their data for laughs.</p>
