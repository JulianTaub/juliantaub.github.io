    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One crucial topic I constantly come across as I am studying at Flatiron is that I always need to be aware and keep track of what values my variables hold throughout my code and how they change over time.</p>

<p>I cannot drill this into my head enough. Or tell you how many times being sloppy has ruined an afternoon.</p>

<p>Let’s start at the very beginning…</p>

<p>The Ruby language has very few set keywords, so most of the work will come from you, the programmer, defining your own variables, meaning storing information by associating a name with a value (or technically, an object that has a value):</p>

<pre><code class="`ruby">  x = 14
  food = “pasta”
  cities = [New York, Berlin, Dallas, Shanghai]
</code></pre>

<p>You use the variables as placeholders for data, so you can manipulate it for whatever program you’re working on. The problem arises when you call methods on the data, functions that operate on data in specific ways. Some are fairly straight forward. For example, most people can infer that:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">  x = 14
  x = x + 6
</code></pre>

<p>reassigns x to equal 20. However, other methods are less obvious. It’s always important to understand how each one “returns” a value. A method like puts prints to your screen, but returns a nil value. Other methods will change a copy of the data, leaving the variable’s original data intact.</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby">  puts “Return me, please!” # =&gt; nil

  name = “Julian”
  name.upcase  # =&gt; “JULIAN”
  name         # =&gt; “Julian” 
</code></pre>

<p>Some guidelines to keep in mind while tracking your variable:</p>

<ul>
<li> Ruby always returns the last value of a program. Think of how to use that to your advantadge.</li>
<li> Ruby has built-in implicit returns, meaning just writing the variable is enough to get the value.</li>
<li> Just because something is printed on the screen, doesn’t mean that the same value was returned in the program.</li>
<li> Keep track of incrementing values, and methods that take multiple arguments</li>
<li> Always read documentation for the nitty-gritty details. <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby-doc.org</a> is the place to be.</li>
<li> Get dirty in the sandbox: Test out code snippets in the terminal using <em>irb</em>, or hacking into programs as they are running, using the <em>pry</em> gem.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://umbandaeucurto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jorge_07_Ze_Pilintra_umbandaeucurto-610x259.jpg" alt="Picture of Ze Pilintra, fokloric trickster character of the Umbanda religion of Brazil" /></p>

<p>In Brazilian culture, the word “malandro” is a very controversial term. It’s usually has the connotation of a rogue, a gutter-punk, or a trickster. Someone who is very devious and dosen’t play by the rules. They follow a way of life called “malandragem,” or getting the advantage by any means possible.</p>

<p>It evokes a bit of a bad-boy persona, one that’s memorialized in songs and folklore.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thisbusinessofdanceandmusic.com/images/kick.jpg" alt="Picture of capoeira fight" /></p>

<p>But in martial arts like capoeira, malandro and malandragem has a much more positive meaning. There it describes someone who is extremely versatile and can problem solve on cue. Fluid situational awareness and unconventional problem solving then take on an almost positive quality.</p>

<p>The word “hacker” can be just as controversial. In the programming community, hackers are inventive makers and testers, participating in a vibrant collaborative community. To the outside world, hackers are malcontents and thieves, bent on destroying people’s online lives and corrupt their data for laughs.</p>

<p>Sometimes the steretype gets taken to the extreme…</p>

<p>Hackers are a lot like malandros - they make things work, adapting to problems and systems at the tip of a fedora with everything they have on hand in any way they can. There’s no straight and narrow thinking - just bubbly, shapeshifting inventness.</p>

<p>Oi malandro e malandro!</p>
